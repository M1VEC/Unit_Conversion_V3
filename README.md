# Unit_Conversion_V3
Attempting to create version 3 of my unit conversion program with the aim of removing the procedural 
programming mentality of version 2. 

Goals:
1) add mass
2) refactor units to a parent class that feeds the ratios to cut down on repeated code
3) refactor parse methods to parent class
